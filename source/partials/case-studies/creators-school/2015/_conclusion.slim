          ' It sounded absolutely perfect. We liked the thought that code could
          ' be a superpower. Creators School is all about turning ordinary people
          ' into super-heroes by teaching them how to speak the language of
          ' computers.

          ' This idea helped us show people what coding can be
          ' nowadays. We associated our message about debunking the myths that
          ' surround coding with illustrations of superheroes and the testimonies
          ' of real professionals. We also managed to communicate what some of
          ' these technologies actually are, and how they can change peopleâ€™s
          ' lives for the better. The success of this initiative is a step
          | towards making the third edition of Creators School a success.
